**** [[https://nib-it.atlassian.net/browse/PHISL-1057][PHISL-1057]]
     - [1] Core API has assessment_date_person_1 and assessment_date_person_2 fields
     - [2] Pricing API takes two parameters:
       + ageBasedDiscountAssessmentDate
       + partnerAgeBasedDiscountAssessmentDate
     - We map these parameters [1] to [2]
     - There is a few other fields in review environment: previous_fund_discount_person_1, previous_fund_discount_person_2 which have not been mapped on https://git.nib.com.au/nib-au/pricing-api/pull/47/files
**** [[https://nib-it.atlassian.net/browse/PHISL-1058][PHISL-1058]]
     - Same as above, but for split invoice
**** [[https://nib-it.atlassian.net/browse/PHISL-733][PHISL-733]]
     - Calculates the first payment amount
     - Passes the cover_date_from and cover_date_to.
     - Core Apps should return the first payment amount inside of the ~payment_for_premium~ fields
