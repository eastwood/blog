** Purpose 
   I've found that my natural inclination is to develop a general knowledge of a topic, without truly mastering it. This blog is my remedy for that, an attempt to apply the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow][system2]] of my brain in order to explore tech in enough [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%2527s_taxonomy][detail]] that I can write and teach it. This blog will serve as a braindump of ideas, problems, experiences and philosophy. 

** Discourse
   I'm an advocate for open discourse and critical thinking and constructive criticism. If you agree, or more importantly, disagree with anything I write, I'd love to engage in productive conversaition. You can find where to reach me in the footer below.
